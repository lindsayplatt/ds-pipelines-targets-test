I used this repo to try out the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/index.html) package by following along with the DS Pipelines courses. I saved the result of each of the pipelines courses in separate branches.

To follow along, I couldn't do the actual course in Git Learning Lab because I wasn't going to complete the exact steps it wanted me to complete. Instead, I followed along with the steps by manually stepping through the `.md` files.
